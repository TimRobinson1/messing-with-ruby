# Simple & Fun Ruby Programs

This directory is primarily for Ruby code created to learn and mess around with in order to understand it better.

## Text Adventure

The text adventure is a small program just to experiment whilst working with Ruby.
It is currently unfinished, and may remain so, as it is primarily for learning.

## Zombie adventure

The zombie text-based adventure is an attempt to build a responsive text-based survival game with Ruby during which you have to manage resources and survivors to survive for as long as you can.

There's no goal, just survive as long as possible.  It's currently unfinished, and more features will be added as time goes on.

## Codewars Experiments

These programs are the succinct answers to various kata that I've found and gathered here
either to experiment with them, learn how the work, or implement them in my own code.

## Usage

These programs can simply be used on the command line by calling it with `ruby <filename>`
